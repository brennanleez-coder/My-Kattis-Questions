# My-Kattis-Questions
Hey Everyone! Do read the readme before using any code provided.

Having learned Data Structures and Algorithms using Kattis as my avenue for learning, I believe it is a good platform to hone your coding skills and computational thinking as the questions are readily available and computer-graded thus you are able to learn at any time of the day.
One important point I must emphasise is that any plagiarism of my code will be reflected on Kattis plagiarism report.
If you are using Kattis for a school course, you will fail the module as Kattis reflects plagiarism to their school partners.
Please use my repository as hints to solving the questions using your own code.
